### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Erin! (she/her/hers)

I'm currently an (almost-graduated!) full-stack developer student in The London App Brewery's complete web development bootcamp. I've been dabbling in coding since I first started playing around with Python when I was a university student, but seriously started writing code in February of 2022. 

- :beginner: **My very first program** was a basic Python magic-8 ball program (it's not here, if you're looking for it...but I promise it's a real thing). I wrote my Python fidget spinner as my second project-of-note!

- :star: **My current favorite technology** is React (components are brilliant, imo). My most-recent React app is a Google Keep clone -- Take Note! I've deployed it [here](https://take-note-app.vercel.app/) using Vercel hosting. I'm currently updating it to add a back-end so it will store created notes.  

- :trophy: **Some of my other recently-completed projects** are my [blog](https://hidden-atoll-31231.herokuapp.com/) and my [Whisper App clone](https://quiet-wave-88262.herokuapp.com/). Both have an EJS/JS front-end, Node  and Express back-end, and use MongoDB databases. My Whisper clone was created specifically to practice with different authentication tools, so it also has GoogleOAuth set up! I've also just built my first RESTful API in JavaScript with Studio 3T for MongoDB and Postman.

- :computer: **I'm currently working on** building the back-end to my Take Note app, and I've just started wireframing a full-stack React app about wine (stay tuned for more!). 

- :seedling: **I'm currently learning** some web3 stuff just for kicks and giggles.

- :dancers: **I'd love help** with open-source recommendations!

Other things about me...
- :running: I run! I prefer 10k and half-marathon distances, but I'd love to run a full marathon in the next year or so!
- :books: I love to read. My all-time favorite book is Jane Austen's *Persuasion*, but my current favorite is *Red, White, and Royal Blue* by Casey McQuiston...it's just a sweet, feel good, romantic comedy that makes me feel good about the world. 
- :cat: Big cat person. Dogs are cool too, but my cat is the absolute best. 
- :earth_americas: I've moved roughly every four years of my life -- I've lived in almost every geographic region of the continental United States and briefly lived in Ireland.
