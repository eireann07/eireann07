### Hi, there! 👋

I'm Erin! (she/her/hers)

I'm currently an (almost-graduated!) full-stack developer student in The London App Brewery's complete web development bootcamp. I've been dabbling in coding since I first started playing around with Python when I was a university student, but seriously started writing code in January of 2022. 

- :beginner: **My very first program** was a basic Python magic-8 ball program (it's not here, if you're looking for it...but I promise it's a real thing). I wrote my Python fidget spinner as my second project-of-note!

- :star: **My current favorite technology** is React (components are brilliant, imo). My first React app is a simplified Instagram clone for cats -- Catstagram! I've deployed it [here](https://catstagram-navy.vercel.app/) using Vercel hosting. I'm currently updating it to make it more responsive for mobile interfaces.  

- :computer: **I'm currently working on** connecting databases to my [to-do app](https://github.com/eireann07/todolist-v1) and my [blog](https://github.com/eireann07/blog-v1) so that I can deploy them fully-functioning.

- :seedling: **I'm currently learning** some web3 stuff just for kicks and giggles.

- :dancers: **I'd love help** with open-source recommendations!

Other things about me...
- :running: I run! I prefer 10k and half-marathon distances, but I'd love to run a full marathon in the next year or so!
- :books: I love to read. My all-time favorite book is Jane Austen's *Persuasion*, but my current favorite is *Red, White, and Royal Blue* by Casey McQuiston...it's just a sweet, feel good, romantic comedy that makes me feel good about the world. 
- :cat: Big cat person. Dogs are cool too, but my cat is the absolute best. 
- :earth_americas: I've moved roughly every four years of my life -- I've lived in almost every geographic region of the continental United States and briefly lived in Ireland.
